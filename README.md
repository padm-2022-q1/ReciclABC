## Building the app
You need an API key for the Maps and Places SDKs for Android in order to render the map. Add it to your `local.properties` file, as in the example below:

```properties
MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE
```

Your GCP project needs to have an enabled billing account and these APIs enabled:
 * Maps SDK for Android
 * Places API

Your key also needs to allow access to these APIs.
